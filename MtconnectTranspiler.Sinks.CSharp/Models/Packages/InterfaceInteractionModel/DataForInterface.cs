Details on data items specific to the {{term(interaction model)}} for each type of {{term(interface)}} are provided in {{package(DataItem Types for Interface)}}.

An implementer may choose any other data available from a piece of equipment to describe the operating states and other information needed to support an {{term(interface)}}.

### References for Interface

Some of the data items needed to support a specific {{term(interface)}} may already be defined elsewhere in the {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}} for a piece of equipment.  However, the implementer may not be able to directly associate this data with the {{term(interface)}} since the MTConnect Standard does not permit multiple occurrences of a piece of data to be configured in an {{term(MTConnectDevices Response Document)}}.  {{block(References)}} provides a mechanism for associating information defined elsewhere in the {{term(information model)}} for a piece of equipment with a specific {{term(interface)}}.  

{{block(References)}} {{termplural(organize)}} {{block(Reference)}} elements.

{{block(Reference)}} is a pointer to information that is associated with another entity defined elsewhere for a piece of equipment.

{{block(References)}} is an economical syntax for providing interface specific information without directly duplicating the occurrence of the data. It provides a mechanism to include all necessary information required for interaction and deterministic information flow between pieces of equipment.

For more information on the {{block(References)}} model, see {{package(Device Information Model)}}.&#10;
