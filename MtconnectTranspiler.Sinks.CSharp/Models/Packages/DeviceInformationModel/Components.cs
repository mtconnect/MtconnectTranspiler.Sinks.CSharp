A variety of entities are defined to describe a piece of equipment.  Some of these entities **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity, while others are optional and **MAY** be used, as required, to provide additional structure.

The first, or highest level, entity defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity is {{block(Devices)}}. {{block(Devices)}} is used to group one or more pieces of equipment into a single document.  {{block(Devices)}} **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

{{block(Device)}} is the next entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. A separate {{block(Device)}} entity is used to identify each piece of equipment for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. Each {{block(Device)}} provides information on the physical and logical structure of the piece of equipment and the data associated with that equipment. {{block(Device)}} can also represent any logical grouping of pieces of equipment that function as a unit or any other data source that provides data through an {{term(agent)}}.

One or more {{block(Device)}} entities **MUST** always be defined for an {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity.

{{block(Components)}} is the next entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. {{block(Components)}} is used to group information describing lower level physical parts or logical functions of a piece of equipment.

{{block(Component)}} is the next level of entity defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity. {{block(Component)}} is both an abstract type entity and an {{term(organizer)}} type entity. 

As an abstract entity, {{block(Component)}} will always be realized by a specific {{block(Component)}} type defined in {{package(Component Types)}}. Each {{block(Component)}} can also be used to organize information describing {{term(lower level)}} entities or {{termplural(DataItem)}} associated with the {{block(Component)}}.

If {{term(lower level)}} entities are described, these entities are by definition child {{block(Component)}} entities of a parent {{block(Component)}}. At this next level, the {{term(lower level)}} child {{block(Component)}} entities are grouped by {{block(Components)}}.

A {{block(Component)}} **MAY** be further decomposed into {{block(Composition)}} entities that are grouped by {{block(Compositions)}}. These describe the lowest level basic structural or functional building blocks contained within a {{block(Component)}}. Data provided for a {{block(Component)}} provides more specific meaning when it is associated with one of the {{block(Composition)}} entities of the {{block(Component)}}. The different {{block(Composition)}} types that **MAY** be defined for the {{block(MTConnectDevices)}} entity are defined in {{package(Compositions)}}.

This parent-child relationship can continue to any depth required to fully define a piece of equipment.
